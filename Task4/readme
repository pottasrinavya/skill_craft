🚦 Task 04 – Traffic Accident Data Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. It also includes visualization of accident hotspots and identification of contributing factors using simulated accident data.

📦 Requirements
pip install pandas numpy
pip install matplotlib seaborn folium
(for visualizations, mapping, and deeper analysis if extended)

📝 Dataset Description
This project uses a synthetic dataset generated with:

accident_time: Random hourly timestamps

weather: Categorical weather condition (e.g., Clear, Rain, Fog, Snow)

road_condition: Type of road surface (Dry, Wet, Icy)

latitude, longitude: Simulated coordinates for mapping accident locations

Sample:
  accident_time weather road_condition  latitude  longitude
0         07:00   Clear            Dry  51.5836  -0.0679
1         00:00    Snow            Wet  51.5975  -0.0480
📊 Objective
🔍 Analyze how weather and road conditions contribute to accidents.

🕒 Examine the time-of-day patterns (e.g., night vs. day).

📍 Visualize accident hotspots using geolocation.

🔧 How It Works
Step 1: Generate random accident records using numpy and pandas

Step 2: Analyze distributions using grouping and counting

Step 3: (Optional) Extend using matplotlib, seaborn, or folium for heatmaps

🧠 Learning Outcome
You’ll learn how to:

Work with categorical and geospatial data

Simulate and analyze real-world-like datasets

Build the foundation for geospatial visualization of accidents
