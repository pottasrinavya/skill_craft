🛳️ Task 02 – Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset
This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. The goal is to explore the relationships between different variables and uncover patterns and trends, especially those affecting passenger survival.

📌 Task Overview
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice — here we use the Titanic Dataset available in Seaborn or from Kaggle.

📁 Files Included
task-2.py – Python script that includes:

Data cleaning

Summary statistics

Visualizations and insights

📦 Requirements

pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy
📊 Key Exploratory Analysis Performed
Data Cleaning

Removed columns with excessive null values (deck, embark_town, alive)

Filled missing age with median

Filled missing embarked values with mode

Dropped any remaining missing values

Descriptive Statistics

Used .describe() and .info() to summarize and understand the dataset

Visualizations

✅ Gender distribution

✅ Survival count by gender

✅ Passenger class distribution

✅ Age distribution (histogram with KDE)

✅ Survival rate by class (bar plot)

✅ Correlation heatmap for numeric variables

✅ Survival by age group (child, teen, adult, etc.)

✅ Survival by embarkation port

📷 Output Snapshots (Visuals)
The script will display multiple charts with valuable insights into:

Which groups had higher survival rates

Age and class impact on survival

Port of embarkation and survival distribution
