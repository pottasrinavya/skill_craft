🌳 Task 03 – Decision Tree Classifier: Bank Marketing Dataset
In this project, we build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product (subscribe to a term deposit) based on their demographic and behavioral data. The dataset used is the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

📦 Requirements
Install the necessary libraries using:

pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
🔍 Dataset Info
Dataset: bank-additional.csv

Source: UCI Bank Marketing Dataset

Target Variable: y (whether the client subscribed to a term deposit)

⚙️ Project Workflow
Data Loading

Load dataset with proper separator (sep=';')

Preprocessing

Encode all categorical variables using LabelEncoder

Define features (X) and target (y)

Model Training

Split data using train_test_split

Train a DecisionTreeClassifier with max_depth=5

Model Evaluation

Accuracy Score

Classification Report

Confusion Matrix (visualized using seaborn.heatmap)

Visualization

Full decision tree plot with feature and class names
